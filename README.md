### Project structure

* All React components are in the `~/app/components` directory. Each component directory contains a self-named `Component_Name.js` file. Each component has its own `index.js` and `styles.js` files. eg

    > ~/app/components/Spinner/Spinner.js <br>
    > ~/app/components/Spinner/index.js <br>
    > ~/app/components/Spinner/styles.js <br>

* App pages are in the `~/app/screens` directory. eg
 
    > ~/app/screens/Home.js <br>

* The database configuration is in the  `~/db/DbConfig.js` file.

* `~/app/index.js` is the entry point for all components in the `~/app` directory. It acts as a bridge between the `~/app` directory and the `App.js` file.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
